I'm Hanbyeol, a frontend developer who codes with the user in mind.\nI believe the best products come from clear communication, genuine collaboration, and always asking \"how does this serve the person using it?\"\nMy advertising background taught me to put the customer firstâ€”a principle I carry into every project.\n I'm naturally curious and love diving deeper than the task at hand to uncover better solutions."
